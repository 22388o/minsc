# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add script fragment interpolation syntax

  With a space-separated list of expressions enclosed in backticks. For example: ``` `1 2 OP_DUP OP_ADD 3 OP_EQUAL` ```

  The data types that can be interpolated are: Scripts, Descriptor, Miniscript and Policy (concatenated as script bytes), as well as Number, PubKey, Hash, Duration and DateTime (as PUSH operations).

- Add anonymous function expressions

  With a Rust-like syntax: `|params| body` or `|params| { multi statement body }`

- New `Script` runtime data type and `script_pubkey()`/`script_witness()` functions

- Add support for multi-line `/* .. */` comments

- Allow using non-literal expressions as the array access index

  For example: `$list.$n` or `$list.(some complex expression)`
